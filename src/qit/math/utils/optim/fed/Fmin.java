c  input..
c
c  ax    left endpoint of initial interval
c  bx    right endpoint of initial interval
c  f     function subprogram which evaluates f(x) for any x
c        in the interval (ax,bx)

c        result (.ge.0.)

c
c  fmin  abcissa approximating the point where  f  attains a
c        minimum
c
c     The method used is a combination of golden section search and
c  successive parabolic interpolation.  Convergence is never much slower
c  than that for a Fibonacci search.  If f has a continuous second
c  derivative which is positive at the minimum (which is not at ax or
c  bx), then convergence is superlinear, and usually of the order of
c  about 1.324.
c     The function f is never evaluated at two points closer together
c  than eps*abs(fmin)+(tol/3), where eps is approximately the square
c  root of the relative machine precision.  If f is a unimodal
c  function and the computed values of f are always unimodal when
c  separated by at least eps*abs(x)+(tol/3), then fmin approximates
c  the abcissa of the global minimum of f on the interval (ax,bx) with
c  an error less than 3*eps*abs(fmin)+tol.  If f is not unimodal,
c  then fmin may approximate a local, but perhaps non-global, minimum to
c  the same accuracy.
c      This function subprogram is a slightly modified version of the
c  Algol 60 procedure localmin given in Richard Brent, Algorithms For
c  Minimization Without Derivatives, Prentice-Hall, Inc. (1973).
