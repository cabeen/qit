# Name: QMODELFIT
#
# Description:
#
#   Fit a diffusion model volume with parallel processing.  This breaks the 
#   volume into blocks (smaller than a slice), distributes model fittings
#   to the grid, and combines the results back into a full model volume.  
#   This can reduce the total runtime from hours to under 20 minutes.
# 
#   The module must have an interface like so:
# 
#     qit ModuleName \
#        --input dwi.nii.gz \
#        --gradients bvecs.txt \
#        --mask mask.nii.gz \
#        --output output.modelname \
#        [opts]
#
#   The module supports the following environment variables:
#
#     QMODELFIT_I: the size of the block in the i-dimension
#     QMODELFIT_J: the size of the block in the j-dimension
#     QMODELFIT_K: the size of the block in the k-dimension
#
# Author: Ryan Cabeen
