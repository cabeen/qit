function root = BesselJ_RootsCyl(starts)
% BesselJ_RootsCyl(starts) finds the roots of the equation J'_1(x) = 0
% where J_1 is the first order Bessel function of the first kind.
%
% starts is the number of starting points in the search for
% roots.  The larger it is, the more roots are returned in the root array.
% The default is 20, which returns 6 roots.  starts = 100 returns 32 roots.
% Generally the number of roots is just under 1/3 the number of starting
% points.
