function loglik = RicianLogLik(meas, signals, sig)
% Computes the log likelihood of the measurements given the model signals
% for the Rician noise model.
%
% loglik = RicianLogLik(meas, signals, sig) returns the likelihood of
% measuring meas given the signals and the noise standard deviation sig. 
%
% meas are the measurements
%
% signals are computed from a model
%
% sig is the standard deviation of the Gaussian distributions underlying
% the Rician distribution.
