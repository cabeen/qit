What is this?
=============

This is example code for developing a QIT plugin.  This lets you implement a
new tool that can be integrated directly into QIT.  The basic idea is to help
avoid having to implement code to handle file formats, command line arguments,
and basic algorithms.

How do I use it?
================

Check out these examples:

  ${THIS_DIR}/src/qit/data/modules/volume/ModuleTemplate.java
  ${THIS_DIR}/src/qit/main/MainTemplate.java

The first is an example of a module.  This is the easiest option, since it
handles the command line arguments for you and will be accessible in qitview.
The second option is an example of a more flexible program with a custom
command line interface, which is only necessary if you have input/output needs
that don't fit the module framework.

Once you have done this, you can build and install it with:

  ant install

This will compile the code and copy it to a place in "~/.qit" where qitview can
find it.  If all goes, your new module will show up on the menu in qitview.
